# PhysicsBasedCharacterController
A cool physics based character controller based on @toyful_games 's game Very Very Valet. You're welcome to make additions.

Here's the important stuff you need to know.
You're 100% Welcome to use this in your own projects.

If you want to add new stuff:
-Please focus on adding GAMEPLAY features. 
Nothing visual please. This is supposed to stay completely neutral so that people can use it for their projects.
-Focus on the ONE player character please. You are welcome to add vehicules or other modes of movement, but if so, 
please add them in a non-destructive way that is still connected to the base player character.

If you use this in your own project,
you're DEFINITELY not forced to credit me. This is a free license thing. But you're 100% WELCOME to credit me.
